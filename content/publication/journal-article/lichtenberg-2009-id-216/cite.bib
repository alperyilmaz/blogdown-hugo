  abstract = {Abstract-- Encyclopedias of regulatory genomic elements provide a foundation for 
 research in areas such as disease diagnosis, disease treatment, and crop enhancement. The 
 construction of complete encyclopedias of organism-specific genomic elements involved in gene 
 regulation remains a significant challenge. To address this problem, the authors present novel 
 bioinformatics strategies for exploring the word andscapes of putative regulatory regions of 
 genomes. The methods are incorporated into the WordSeeker software tool, which is available at 
 http://word-seeker.org. The effectiveness of these strategies is demonstrated through several 
 case studies.},
