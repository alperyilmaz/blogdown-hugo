  Encyclopedias of regulatory genomic elements provide a foundation for research in areas such as disease diagnosis, disease treatment, and crop enhancement. The construction of complete encyclopedias of organism-specific genomic elements involved in gene regulation remains a significant challenge. To address this problem, the authors present novel bioinformatics strategies for exploring the word andscapes of putative regulatory regions of genomes. The methods are incorporated into the WordSeeker software tool, which is available at [http://word-seeker.org](http://word-seeker.org). The effectiveness of these strategies is demonstrated through several case studies.
