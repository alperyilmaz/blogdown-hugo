 abstract = {KNOTTED1 (KN1)-like homeobox (KNOX) transcription factors function in plant
meristems, self-renewing structures consisting of stem cells and their
immediate daughters. We defined the KN1 cistrome in maize inflorescences
and found that KN1 binds to several thousand loci, including 643 genes that
are modulated in one or multiple tissues. These KN1 direct targets are
strongly enriched for transcription factors (including other homeobox
genes) and genes participating in hormonal pathways, most significantly
auxin, demonstrating that KN1 plays a key role in orchestrating the upper
levels of a hierarchical gene regulatory network that impacts plant
meristem identity and function.},
