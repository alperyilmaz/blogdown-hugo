 abstract = {Lymphoma is a malignant neoplasm arising from B or T lymphocytes. In dogs,
one-third of lymphomas are highly aggressive multicentric T-cell lymphomas
that are often associated with humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy (HHM).
There are no cell lines or animal models to investigate the pathogenesis of
T-cell lymphoma and HHM in dogs. We developed the first xenograft model by
injecting lymphoma cells from an Irish Wolfhound intraperitoneally into
NOD/SCID mice. The mice developed multicentric lymphoma along with HHM and
increased parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) as occurs in dogs
with T-cell lymphoma. Using cytokine complementary DNA arrays, we
identified genes that have potential implications in the pathogenesis of
T-cell lymphoma. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) of T-cell lymphoma samples from hypercalcaemic canine
patients showed that PTHrP likely plays a central role in the pathogenesis
of HHM and that hypercalcaemia is the result of a combinatorial effect of
different hypercalcaemic factors. Finally, we monitored in vivo tumour
progression and metastases in the mouse model by transducing the lymphoma
cells with a lentiviral vector that encodes a luciferase-yellow fluorescent
protein reporter and showed that in vivo trafficking patterns in this model
were similar to those seen in dogs. This unique mouse model will be useful
for translational research in lymphoma and for investigating the
pathogenesis of T-cell lymphoma and HHM in the dog.},
