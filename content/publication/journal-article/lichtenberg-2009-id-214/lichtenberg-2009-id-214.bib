 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome sequences can be conceptualized as arrangements of
motifs or words. The frequencies and positional distributions of these
words within particular non-coding genomic segments provide important
insights into how the words function in processes such as mRNA stability
and regulation of gene expression. RESULTS: Using an enumerative word
discovery approach, we investigated the frequencies and positional
distributions of all 65,536 different 8-letter words in the genome of
Arabidopsis thaliana. Focusing on promoter regions, introns, and 3' and 5'
untranslated regions (3'UTRs and 5'UTRs), we compared word frequencies in
these segments to genome-wide frequencies. The statistically interesting
words in each segment were clustered with similar words to generate motif
logos. We investigated whether words were clustered at particular locations
or were distributed randomly within each genomic segment, and we classified
the words using gene expression information from public repositories.
Finally, we investigated whether particular sets of words appeared together
more frequently than others. CONCLUSION: Our studies provide a detailed
view of the word composition of several segments of the non-coding portion
of the Arabidopsis genome. Each segment contains a unique word-based
signature. The respective signatures consist of the sets of enriched words,
'unwords', and word pairs within a segment, as well as the preferential
locations and functional classifications for the signature words.
Additionally, the positional distributions of enriched words within the
segments highlight possible functional elements, and the co-associations of
words in promoter regions likely represent the formation of higher order
regulatory modules. This work is an important step toward fully cataloguing
the functional elements of the Arabidopsis genome.},
