 abstract = {Establishing the architecture of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) relies on
chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing
(ChIP-Seq) methods that provide genome-wide transcription factor binding
sites (TFBSs). ChIP-Seq furnishes millions of short reads that, after
alignment, describe the genome-wide binding sites of a particular TF.
However, in all organisms investigated an average of 40% of reads fail to
align to the corresponding genome, with some datasets having as much as 80%
of reads failing to align. We describe here the provenance of previously
unaligned reads in ChIP-Seq experiments from animals and plants. We show
that a substantial portion corresponds to sequences of bacterial and
metazoan origin, irrespective of the ChIP-Seq chromatin source. Unforeseen
was the finding that 30%-40% of unaligned reads were actually alignable. To
validate these observations, we investigated the characteristics of the
previously unaligned reads corresponding to TAL1, a human TF involved in
lineage specification of hemopoietic cells. We show that, while unmapped
ChIP-Seq read datasets contain foreign DNA sequences, additional TFBSs can
be identified from the previously unaligned ChIP-Seq reads. Our results
indicate that the re-evaluation of previously unaligned reads from ChIP-Seq
experiments will significantly contribute to TF target identification and
determination of emerging properties of GRNs. },
