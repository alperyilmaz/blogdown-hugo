 abstract = {Three subfamilies of grasses, the Ehrhartoideae, Panicoideae and Pooideae,
provide the bulk of human nutrition and are poised to become major sources
of renewable energy. Here we describe the genome sequence of the wild grass
Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium), which is, to our knowledge, the
first member of the Pooideae subfamily to be sequenced. Comparison of the
Brachypodium, rice and sorghum genomes shows a precise history of genome
evolution across a broad diversity of the grasses, and establishes a
template for analysis of the large genomes of economically important pooid
grasses such as wheat. The high-quality genome sequence, coupled with ease
of cultivation and transformation, small size and rapid life cycle, will
help Brachypodium reach its potential as an important model system for
developing new energy and food crops.},
