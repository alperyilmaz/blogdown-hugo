 abstract = {Translation is a regulated process and is pivotal to proper cell growth and
homeostasis. All retroviruses rely on the host translational machinery for
viral protein synthesis and thus may be susceptible to its perturbation in
response to stress, co-infection, and/or cell cycle arrest. HIV-1 infection
arrests the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, potentially disrupting the
regulation of host cell translation. In this study, we present evidence
that HIV-1 infection downregulates translation in lymphocytes, attributable
to the cell cycle arrest induced by the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr. The
molecular basis of the translation suppression is reduced accumulation of
the active form of the translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). However,
synthesis of viral structural proteins is sustained despite the general
suppression of protein production. HIV-1 mRNA translation is sustained due
to the distinct composition of the HIV-1 ribonucleoprotein complexes.
RNA-coimmunoprecipitation assays determined that the HIV-1 unspliced and
singly spliced transcripts are predominantly associated with nuclear cap
binding protein 80 (CBP80) in contrast to completely-spliced viral and
cellular mRNAs that are associated with eIF4E. The active translation of
the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC)-bound viral mRNAs is demonstrated by
ribosomal RNA profile analyses. Thus, our findings have uncovered that the
maintenance of CBC association is a novel mechanism used by HIV-1 to bypass
downregulation of eIF4E activity and sustain viral protein synthesis. We
speculate that a subset of CBP80-bound cellular mRNAs contribute to
recovery from significant cellular stress, including human retrovirus
infection.},
