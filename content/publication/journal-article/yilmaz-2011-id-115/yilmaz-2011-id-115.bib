 abstract = {The Arabidopsis Gene Regulatory Information Server (AGRIS;
http://arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu/) provides a comprehensive resource
for gene regulatory studies in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Three
interlinked databases, AtTFDB, AtcisDB and AtRegNet, furnish comprehensive
and updated information on transcription factors (TFs), predicted and
experimentally verified cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and their
interactions, respectively. In addition to significant contributions in the
identification of the entire set of TF-DNA interactions, which are the key
to understand the gene regulatory networks that govern Arabidopsis gene
expression, tools recently incorporated into AGRIS include the complete set
of words length 5-15 present in the Arabidopsis genome and the integration
of AtRegNet with visualization tools, such as the recently developed ReIN
application. All the information in AGRIS is publicly available and
downloadable upon registration.},
