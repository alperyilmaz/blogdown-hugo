 abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) are major players in gene regulatory networks
and interactions between TFs and their target genes furnish spatiotemporal
patterns of gene expression. Establishing the architecture of regulatory
networks requires gathering information on TFs, their targets in the
genome, and the corresponding binding sites. We have developed GRASSIUS
(Grass Regulatory Information Services) as a knowledge-based Web resource
that integrates information on TFs and gene promoters across the grasses.
In its initial implementation, GRASSIUS consists of two separate, yet
linked, databases. GrassTFDB holds information on TFs from maize (Zea
mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), and rice
(Oryza sativa). TFs are classified into families and phylogenetic
relationships begin to uncover orthologous relationships among the
participating species. This database also provides a centralized
clearinghouse for TF synonyms in the grasses. GrassTFDB is linked to the
grass TFome collection, which provides clones in recombination-based
vectors corresponding to full-length open reading frames for a growing
number of grass TFs. GrassPROMDB contains promoter and cis-regulatory
element information for those grass species and genes for which enough data
are available. The integration of GrassTFDB and GrassPROMDB will be
accomplished through GrassRegNet as a first step in representing the
architecture of grass regulatory networks. GRASSIUS can be accessed from
www.grassius.org.},
