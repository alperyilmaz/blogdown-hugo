 abstract = {Pericarp Color1 (P1) encodes an R2R3-MYB transcription factor responsible
for the accumulation of insecticidal flavones in maize (Zea mays) silks and
red phlobaphene pigments in pericarps and other floral tissues, which makes
P1 an important visual marker. Using genome-wide expression analyses (RNA
sequencing) in pericarps and silks of plants with contrasting P1 alleles
combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput
sequencing, we show here that the regulatory functions of P1 are much
broader than the activation of genes corresponding to enzymes in a branch
of flavonoid biosynthesis. P1 modulates the expression of several thousand
genes, and ∼1500 of them were identified as putative direct targets of
P1. Among them, we identified F2H1, corresponding to a P450 enzyme that
converts naringenin into 2-hydroxynaringenin, a key branch point in the
P1-controlled pathway and the first step in the formation of insecticidal
C-glycosyl flavones. Unexpectedly, the binding of P1 to gene regulatory
regions can result in both gene activation and repression. Our results
indicate that P1 is the major regulator for a set of genes involved in
flavonoid biosynthesis and a minor modulator of the expression of a much
larger gene set that includes genes involved in primary metabolism and
production of other specialized compounds.},
