 abstract = {The purpose of the online resource presented here, POPcorn (Project Portal
for corn), is to enhance accessibility of maize genetic and genomic
resources for plant biologists. Currently, many online locations are
difficult to find, some are best searched independently, and individual
project websites often degrade over time-sometimes disappearing entirely.
The POPcorn site makes available (1) a centralized, web-accessible resource
to search and browse descriptions of ongoing maize genomics projects, (2) a
single, stand-alone tool that uses web Services and minimal data
warehousing to search for sequence matches in online resources of diverse
offsite projects, and (3) a set of tools that enables researchers to
migrate their data to the long-term model organism database for maize
genetic and genomic information: MaizeGDB. Examples demonstrating POPcorn's
utility are provided herein.},
