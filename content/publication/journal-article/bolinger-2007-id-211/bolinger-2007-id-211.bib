 abstract = {The 5' untranslated region (UTR) of retroviruses contain structured
replication motifs that impose barriers to efficient ribosome scanning. Two
RNA structural motifs that facilitate efficient translation initiation
despite a complex 5' UTR are internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and 5'
proximal post-transcriptional control element (PCE). Here, stringent RNA
and protein analyses determined the 5' UTR of spleen necrosis virus (SNV),
reticuloendotheliosis virus A (REV-A) and human T-cell leukemia virus type
1 (HTLV-1) exhibit PCE activity, but not IRES activity. Assessment of SNV
translation initiation in the natural context of the provirus determined
that SNV is reliant on a cap-dependent initiation mechanism. Experiments
with siRNAs identified that REV-A and HTLV-1 PCE modulate
post-transcriptional gene expression through interaction with host RNA
helicase A (RHA). Analysis of hybrid SNV/HTLV-1 proviruses determined SNV
PCE facilitates Rex/Rex responsive element-independent Gag production and
interaction with RHA is necessary. Ribosomal profile analyses determined
that RHA is necessary for polysome association of HTLV-1 gag and provide
direct evidence that RHA is necessary for efficient HTLV-1 replication. We
conclude that PCE/RHA is an important translation regulatory axis of
multiple lymphotropic retroviruses. We speculate divergent retroviruses
have evolved a convergent RNA-protein interaction to modulate translation
of their highly structured mRNA.},
