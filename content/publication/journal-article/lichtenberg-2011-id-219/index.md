  This chapter focuses on the enhancement of existing plant regulatory databases by adding DNA word encyclopedias. The authors present DNA word encyclopedias for small sets of co-regulated sequences (C-repeat binding factor genes in wheat) and for intergenic regions of an entire genome (Arabidopsis thaliana). It is also shown how the resulting DNA word encyclopedia for Arabidopsis is incorporated into an existing repository, the Arabidopsis Gene Regulatory Information Server (AGRIS). This provides a model for how DNA word encyclopedias can be incorporated into organism specific regulatory databases.
